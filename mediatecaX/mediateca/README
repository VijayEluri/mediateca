Mediateca attempts to keep as much of the DSpace directory structure as possible.  JSP files are maintained in the /jsp directory.  Java source files are organized in the /src file in the same way.

Where does it separate out from JSP?

The view layer of the application is very different in that it uses Jakarta struts as a framework.

More information coming soon in this README file.
